This module adds a field *Sequence* field on account journals that will
allow you to control the order of the payment buttons in the interface
of the point of sale. It requires a patch on the Javascript code of the
point of sale (cf file odoo-point_of_sale.patch) for v8.

In Odoo v9, this feature will be native, cf
https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/3705
