Product Category Tax
====================

This module will allow you to configure sale and purchase taxes on product categories. When you set the product category of a product, the taxes configured on the product category will be copied to the product. It also adds a constraint on products that checks that the taxes configured on the product are the same as the taxes configured on it's related product category.

Configuration
=============

Set the taxes on the product categories via the menu *Sales > Configuration > Product Categories > Product Categories*.
